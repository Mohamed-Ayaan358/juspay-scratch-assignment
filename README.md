# Scratch starter project

To get started:

- Run `npm start` and open http://localhost:3000 to see the app

## This is a clone of MIT-Scratch with motion and lock actions present, alkong with a history tab.

    JUMP TO X

    JUMP TO Y

    JUMP TO RANDOM (X,Y)

    ROTATE ANGLE

    TURN CLOCKWISE

    TURN COUNTERCLOCKWISE

    TALK

    MODIFY SIZE -> Increases the size from the base state [Divided by 100]

    MODIFY COLOR

    MODIFY BACKGROUND COLOR

    DEFINE SIZE -> Modify the size from the base state to reduce or increase size  [Divided by 100]

    PAUSE

    LOOP

    FLAG

### Important points to note while using the application

#### 1. There are 4 tabs, the Sidebar, MidArea, PreviewArea and the history tab.
#### 2. If one wishes to perform a series of actions on the svg then they need to include these actions within the block.
#### 3. If one wishes to perform only one of these actions in the group they can simply click the `Tick Mark`, alternatively you can delete the action by clicking the `Cross Mark`.
#### 4. You also have the ability to create or delete blocks individually.
#### 5. The history keeps track of all the actions performed on the SVG, again you can click the `Tick Mark` to perform the action again.
#### 6. I have also attempted to make the application semi-interactable on smaller devices.
#### 7. The motion, lock and control tabs have their respective actions, they need to be opened to use the actions.
